# HBnB Part 1 – Technical Documentation

Welcome to the battle plan of HBnB — a  chaotic, AirBnB-inspired housing app designed with "Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai" energy. 🗡️

This is **Part 1** of the project, where we don’t code yet (thank god), but instead plan everything like responsible software engineers

## 📚 What’s in this document?

- A high-level architecture diagram 
- A class diagram with real Python-flavored logic (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
- Four sequence diagrams showing what happens when users click buttons
- Explanations that probably started serious and got weird around diagram #3

## 🎓 About This Repo

This repo is part of the Holberton School project **HBnB Evolution**.  
You can find the rest of the app (and hopefully working code) in future parts of this repository. For now, enjoy the pretty pictures.
